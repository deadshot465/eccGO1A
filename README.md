# ECC GKGO1A 2019 Repository
---
This repository is meant for sharing codes among students of GKGO1A 2019 class in ECC College of Computer & Multimedia, Osaka, Japan. The repository is public, so as a result, anyone can clone or fork this repository, but please do note the original purpose of this repository, which might shed some light if you find the code here confusing or lacking some concrete explanations.

Currently there are two branches in the repository:
* **master** - The default branch. For the time being there are several folders that contain the same examples written with different programming languages, for better understanding of the logic behind and how things would be done if written in other languages.
* **experimental** - Experimental samples written with slightly less known or less popular programming languages. The codes here are not fail-safe and might lack proper error handlings.

This README.md is written on Apr. 30, 2019. Japanese version will be added later on.
